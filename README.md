# üõ†Ô∏è 'World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King' Addon Config
\
‚ùì Addons are within [/Interface/Addons](https://github.com/ebears/wotlk-addon-config/tree/main/Interface/AddOns), my saved addon settings are inside [/WTF](https://github.com/ebears/wotlk-addon-config/tree/main/WTF), and my ElvUI settings are in the [WoW Elvui Config.md](https://github.com/ebears/wotlk-addon-config/blob/main/WoW%20Elvui%20Config.md) file.
\
ü§î My Warcraft settings are beyond Ultra, changing any graphics settings *will* revert any changes I've made. These are kept within the [/WTF/Config.wtf](https://github.com/ebears/wotlk-addon-config/tree/main/WTF/Config.wtf) file. Big credit to eldarix#6195 in the [ChromieCraft discord](https://discord.com/invite/BYtPEacERr) for sharing these settings. ‚ù§Ô∏è I've just added a couple lines to enable Fullscreen Windowed mode. 
\
üå∫ I play at 1920x1080 at 60fps with Vsync (because my monitor sux üò¢) so I would recommend turning off Vsync and changing resolution if you have any problems.
\
## ‚ùó Issues
\
üßπ ButtonFacade (Masque) is configured to work with ElvUI, however on interface reloads (and relogs) the action bar buttons glitch out (aka have no background). This is simply fixed by typing "/bf" or going to Esc>Interface>ButtonFacade, and toggling "Enable" for ButtonFacade.
