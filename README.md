# 🛠️ 'World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King' Addon Config
❗ Addons are within [/Interface/Addons](https://github.com/ebears/wotlk-addon-config/tree/main/Interface/AddOns).\
❗ My saved addon settings, game config, and keybinds are inside [/WTF](https://github.com/ebears/wotlk-addon-config/tree/main/WTF).\
❗ My ElvUI settings are in the [WoW Elvui Config.md file](https://github.com/ebears/wotlk-addon-config/blob/main/WoW%20Elvui%20Config.md).

🤔 My Warcraft graphics settings are beyond the Ultra preset, so changing any graphics settings *will* revert any of these custom changes. These are kept within the [/WTF/Config.wtf file](https://github.com/ebears/wotlk-addon-config/tree/main/WTF/Config.wtf). Big credit to eldarix#6195 in the [ChromieCraft discord](https://discord.com/invite/BYtPEacERr) for sharing these settings. ❤️ I've just added a couple lines to enable Fullscreen Windowed mode. 

🌺 I play at 1920x1080 at 60fps with Vsync (because my monitor sux 😢) so I would first recommend turning off Vsync and changing resolution if you have any problems.

## ❓ Issues
🧹 ButtonFacade (Masque) is configured to work with ElvUI, however on interface reloads (and relogs) the action bar buttons bug (have no background). This is simply fixed by typing "/bf" or going to Esc>Interface>ButtonFacade, and toggling "Enable" off then back on under the Backdrop header in the ButtonFacade config.
